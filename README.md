# Vehicle Registration API

This repository provides a **Vehicle Registration API** designed to register vehicles and allow third-party vendors to retrieve vehicle information using the license plate number.

---

## üöó What Does It Do?

- **Vehicle Registration:**  
  Allows users to register vehicles by submitting the license plate number and associated details.
- **API for Third Parties:**  
  Exposes secure API endpoints that enable authorized third-party vendors to fetch vehicle data based solely on the license plate number.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How Does It Work?

1. **Registration Endpoint:**
   - Users (e.g., administrators or authorized personnel) can register new vehicles by sending details (license plate, owner, etc.) to the system via a POST API request.
   - The system validates incoming data and stores it securely in the backend database.

2. **Third-Party Data Retrieval:**
   - Third-party vendors can query the API using a license plate number.
   - The API authenticates requests using tokens or API keys.
   - If the token/API key is valid, the system returns the vehicle's information in JSON format.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

- **Backend Language:** Python (Flask/FastAPI) or Node.js (Express)  
- **Database:** Relational (SQLite, PostgreSQL) or NoSQL (MongoDB) database for storing vehicle data
- **Authentication:**  
  - API key or token-based authentication (e.g., JWT)
- **API Design:**  
  - RESTful endpoints  
  - JSON data format for requests and responses

---

## üóÑÔ∏è How is Data Stored?

- All vehicle registration data (license plate, owner, etc.) is stored in the backend database.
- Each record is indexed by the license plate number for fast lookup.
- API keys/tokens and access logs are securely maintained for auditing and security.

---

## üì° How is the API Designed?

- **Authentication:**  
  - Every API request must include a valid token or API key in the header (`Authorization: Bearer <token>` or `x-api-key: <key>`).
  - Unauthorized requests receive a `401 Unauthorized` response.

- **Endpoints:**
  - `POST /api/vehicles/register` ‚Äî Register a new vehicle (for admins/users)
  - `GET /api/vehicles/{license_plate}` ‚Äî Retrieve info for a vehicle by license plate (for third-party vendors)

- **Response Example:**
  ```json
  {
      "license_plate": "MH12AB1234",
      "owner": "John Doe",
      "vehicle_type": "Car",
      "registration_date": "2025-08-29"
  }
  ```

- **Error Handling:**
  - Invalid or missing API key/token returns a `401 Unauthorized` error.
  - Invalid license plate returns a `404 Not Found` error.
